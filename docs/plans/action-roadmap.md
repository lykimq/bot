# :rocket: Bot Action Roadmap

> High-level action plan for transforming the bot from monolithic to modular architecture

## :dart: Mission
Transform the bot into a modular, testable, and maintainable system while preserving all existing functionality.

---

## :clipboard: Phase 0: Critical Issues Resolution

### [High Priority Fixes](phase0/high-priority-fixes.md)
Critical bugs and security vulnerabilities that must be addressed first (resolves #339, #323, #334)

### [Security & Reliability](phase0/security-reliability.md)
System improvements for better security and operational reliability (resolves #157, #325)

---

## :building_construction: Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure

### [Rate Limiting & API Management](phase1/rate-limiting.md)
Implement intelligent GitHub API quota management to prevent service interruptions (resolves #289)

### [Error Handling & Logging](phase1/error-handling.md)
Implement structured error handling and comprehensive logging for better debugging (resolves #264, #280, #227, #275)

### [Configuration System](phase1/configuration.md)
Extend TOML configuration to eliminate hardcoded repository mappings (resolves #160, #201)

### [Testing Infrastructure](phase1/testing-infrastructure.md)
Establish comprehensive testing framework for safe refactoring (resolves #170)

---

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Phase 2: Modularization

### [Feature Modules](phase2/feature-modules.md)
Break down monolithic `actions.ml` into 10 independent feature modules (resolves #247, #335, #327)

### [Utility Modules](phase2/utility-modules.md)
Split `helpers.ml` into 4 focused utility modules (supports #247)

### [Core Infrastructure](phase2/core-infrastructure.md)
Create dynamic feature dispatch and simplify core bot logic (resolves #223, #248, #52)

## :bar_chart: Architecture Transformation

### Before
```
src/
├── bot.ml (664 lines) - Webhook routing + hardcoded logic
├── actions.ml (3223 lines) - All features mixed together
└── helpers.ml (185 lines) - Mixed utilities
```

### After
```
src/
├── bot.ml (<200 lines) - Pure webhook routing
├── feature_registry.ml - Dynamic dispatch
├── features/ (10 modules) - Independent features
├── utils/ (4 modules) - Focused utilities
├── errors.ml - Structured error handling
├── logger.ml - Comprehensive logging
└── rate_limiter.ml - API management
```

---

## :traffic_light: Implementation Order

1. **Phase 0** - Fix critical bugs and security issues
2. **Phase 1** - Build foundation infrastructure
3. **Phase 2** - Modularize existing codebase

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next to ensure system stability and provide safety nets for subsequent changes.
