# Issue #136: New strange errors in log.

**Priority**: ðŸš¨ High
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

I've seen this happen several times in the log from yesterday and it's new to me. The "No space left on device" error is surprising because sometimes after, we can see some `git fetch` succeeding. I don't know what this `/app/config.lock` is.    ```  22 Apr 2021 15:32:56.695156 <190>1 2021-04-22T13:...
