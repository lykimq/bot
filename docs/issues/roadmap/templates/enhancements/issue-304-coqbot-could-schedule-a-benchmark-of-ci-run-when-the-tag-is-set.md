# Issue #304: Coqbot could schedule a benchmark of CI run when the tag is set.

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

I was thinking that `coqbot` could schedule a CI or bench run when we set the corresponding tag; this would avoid comment noise, and it replaces often two steps (setting the tag + calling coqbot) by one.    I tried searching for this and I didn't find an issue, I hope it is not a duplicate.
