# Issue #231: Ability to mark ci jobs as broken

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

Following discussion in https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16154#issuecomment-1159102457 we should implement the ability to mark CI jobs as broken and get coqbot to create a pull request allowing it to fail, and once that is merged a pull request renabling it. This should reduce some mechanical work.
