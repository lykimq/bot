# Issue #115: stale issue closing / issue triaging

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

I've seen other bots around acting on stale issues, first by giving a 1 month long grace period and then closing issues that are inactive for more than 1 year.    Such a policy would need to be discussed with all the devs.
