# Issue #180: Should coqbot respond with a ðŸ˜• on comments which mention (tag?) @coqbot but don't trigger any action?

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

This might make it easier to know whether the issue is a problem with coqbot seeing the comment at all vs coqbot parsing the comment.  (This idea came up after `@dependabot` thumbs-uped my request to rebase.)
