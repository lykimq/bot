# Issue #72: Handling of overlays

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

Related to #27 , it would be great if coqbot could perform some action when PRs with overlays are merged. It could either merge this PRs automatically [if approved], or post a reminder to the corresponding PR.    We may need some more structured overlay info for that tho.
