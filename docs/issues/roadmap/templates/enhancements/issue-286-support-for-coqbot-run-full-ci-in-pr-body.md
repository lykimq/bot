# Issue #286: Support for `@coqbot run full CI` in PR body.

**Priority**: ðŸ”§ Medium
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

Currently, it is only taken into account in PR comments or review comments.    Examples show that users forget about the `request: full CI` label and want to use the command in the PR body instead: https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/17684
