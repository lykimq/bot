# Issue #131: enhancement: coqbot merge after CI passes

**Priority**: ðŸ”§ Medium
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

It would be nice to be able to write something like `coqbot merge if CI passes` and have the bot wait until the CI passes and only merge if it passes (and tag me if it fails)
