# Issue #271: Document coqbot autominimizer defaults

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Coqbot-minimize-feature says  >`@coqbot minimize` can take options after the minimize, including things like coq: 8.16 ...    It seems 8.16 is the default? Not sure what the default ocaml is, or what the other options are.  Also I guess the version is an opam package ...
