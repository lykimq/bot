# Issue #182: [wish] Minimize outdated posts

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

Take https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/15220 , I got spammed a lot. In order to make the thread "readable" I did *manually* mark all old coqbot messages as outdated. IMO the bot could do that automatically when posting a new message.
