# Issue #292: [CI minimization] File name should include project info rather than be `bug.v`

**Priority**: ðŸš¨ High
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Hard

## Problem Description

Suggested by @herbelin , I believe, on the feedback survey    This plausibly needs some edits on the bug minimizer runner, and we'll need to edit the yml job to have the custom file name
