# Issue #195: Fix pluralization of unfound jobs

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

"could not be found among the jobs lint" is mis-pluralized in https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/14748#issuecomment-1003116849, and maybe we should indicate what the list of jobs we're reporting is (is "lint" a candidate for minimization? a failed job?  a job?)
