# Issue #216: Minimizer should report less when continuing minimization

**Priority**: ðŸš€ Low
**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Description

See https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/15693#issuecomment-1075206602    The minimizer should not spam the almost minimized files and instead wait for the user to ask about the status. We could have `@coqbot check minimization` or something to get a partially minimized file.    cc @JasonGross
