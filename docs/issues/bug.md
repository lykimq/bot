## [#339 - Recent issue when pushing status check](https://github.com/rocq-prover/bot/issues/339)

- **Status**: Open
- **Opened by**: Zimmi48 on Mar 31, 2025
- **Labels**: bug
- **Description**: Reported at https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/pull/20421#issuecomment-2763298699.

## [#335 - Confusion between stdlib and stdlib-flambda when it fails](https://github.com/rocq-prover/bot/issues/335)

- **Status**: Open
- **Opened by**: Zimmi48 on Jan 31, 2025
- **Labels**: bug
- **Description**: https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/19978  The issue was closed both by the PR and the commit that were merged. As a consequence, coqbot receives two webhooks that triggered its milestone changing procedure.  This seems like a minor annoyance that may not even be worth fixing.

- **Status**: Open
- **Opened by**: mattiasdrp on Mar 31, 2022
- **Labels**: bug
- **Description**: I haven't investigated it thoroughly but if my body contains the escape sequence `^[`, it looks like Mirage_crypto is producing the wrong SHA1 and the bot fails because it thinks that the webhook is signed with a wrong signature.    What I find strange is that I'm sure I used it previously with no p...

- **Description**: I've seen this happen several times in the log from yesterday and it's new to me.
