## Overview

This document describes the improvement roadmap for the bot (used by the Rocq Prover and community projects), a multi-function automation bot written in OCaml that bridges GitHub and GitLab platforms. The bot is currently used by the Rocq Prover development team and dozens of other projects.

## Current State

The bot is functional but has architectural issues that make it difficult to maintain and extend:
- Monolithic structure (~4000 lines in 2 main files)
- Hardcoded repository configurations
- Limited error handling and logging
- No automated testing

## Goal

Transform the bot into a modular, testable, and maintainable system while preserving all existing functionality.

## Phases

The improvement is divided into:
- **Phase 0**: Open Issues (address critical bugs and security vulnerabilities first)
- **Phase 1**: Critical Foundations (rate limiting, error handling, logging, configuration, testing)
- **Phase 2**: Modularization (break down monolithic files into feature modules)
