## Goal

Fix immediate pain points and establish infrastructure for safe refactoring in Phase 1.

## Overview

Phase 0 focuses on critical fixes that must be in place before any major refactoring:
- Rate limiting to prevent API exhaustion
- Structured error handling for better debugging
- Logging infrastructure for visibility and troubleshooting
- Configuration refactoring to eliminate hardcoded mappings
- Testing infrastructure for safe refactoring

## Components

1. **[Critical Fixes](04-phase0-critical-fixes.md)** - Rate limiting, error handling, logging
2. **[Configuration Refactoring](05-phase0-conf-refact.md)** - Move repository mappings to TOML, configuration validation
3. **[Testing Infrastructure](06-phase0-testing-infra.md)** - Unit test framework

## Why This First

These foundations are essential before modularization because:
- **Rate limiting** prevents production incidents during refactoring
- **Structured errors** help debug issues introduced by changes
- **Logging** provides visibility into bot operations and issues
- **Configuration** enables testing without hardcoded values
- **Testing suite** provides safety net for refactoring in Phase 1
