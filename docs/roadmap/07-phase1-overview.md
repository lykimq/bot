## Goal

Break down monolithic files (`bot.ml`, `actions.ml`, `helpers.ml`) into independent, testable feature modules.

## Overview

Phase 2 transforms the codebase from a monolithic structure into a modular architecture:
- Extract +10 feature modules from `actions.ml` and `bot.ml`
- Create 4 utility modules from `helpers.ml`
- Simplify `bot.ml` to pure routing logic
- Implement feature registry for dynamic dispatch


**Result**: Each feature becomes independently testable and maintainable module (~200-300 lines each).

## Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 2, Phase 1 must be complete:
- :white_check_mark: Rate limiting in place (prevents API exhaustion during refactoring)
- :white_check_mark: Structured errors (helps debug issues from refactoring)
- :white_check_mark: Logging infrastructure (provides visibility during refactoring)
- :white_check_mark: Configuration extended (enables feature-based dispatch)
- :white_check_mark: Test suite established (provides safety net)

**Why this order matters**: Modularization involves moving a lot of code. Having tests, proper error handling, logging, and rate limiting in place first makes the refactoring safer and allows us to catch issues early.
