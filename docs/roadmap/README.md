# :world_map: Bot Improvement Roadmap

A comprehensive roadmap for transforming the bot from a monolithic codebase into a modular, testable, and maintainable system.

## :books: Structure

This roadmap is organized into digestible sections for easy navigation and understanding.

### :dart: Introduction
- **[Overview](00-overview.md)** - Project goals, scope, and phases
- **[Current Architecture](01-current-architecture.md)** - Understanding the existing system
- **[Critical Issues](02-critical-issues.md)** - Problems that need to be addressed

### :bug: Phase 0: Open Issues
Address critical issues and establish foundation for system improvements:
- **[Open Issues Overview](open_issues.md)** - High-level view of all open issues by priority

### :building_construction: Phase 1: Critical Foundations
Establish infrastructure needed before major refactoring:
- **[Phase 1 Overview](03-phase0-overview.md)** - Goals and component breakdown
- **[Critical Fixes](04-phase0-critical-fixes.md)** - Rate limiting, structured error handling, logging
- **[Configuration Refactoring](05-phase0-conf-refact.md)** - Extend TOML config, validation
- **[Testing Infrastructure](06-phase0-testing-infra.md)** - Unit test framework

### :wrench: Phase 2: Modularization
Break down monolithic files into feature modules:
- **[Phase 2 Overview](07-phase1-overview.md)** - Goals and approach
- **[Code Structure Analysis](08-phase1-code-structure-analysis.md)** - What moves where and why
  - [Project Structure](08a-project-structure.md) - Before & After comparison
  - [Architecture Diagrams](08b-architecture-diagrams.md) - Visualizing current and proposed architecture
  - [Feature Identification](08c-feature-identification.md) - Complete feature catalog
  - [Conclusion](09-conclusion.md) - Summary, key principles


## :dart: Goals

1. **Issue Resolution** - Address critical bugs and security vulnerabilities first
2. **Modularity** - Independent, focused modules instead of monolithic files
3. **Testability** - Comprehensive test suite
4. **Maintainability** - Clear structure, easy to understand and modify
5. **Reliability** - Rate limiting, structured errors, better logging
6. **Configurability** - TOML-based config instead of hardcoded logic
