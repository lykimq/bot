## Summary

This improvement roadmap transforms the bot from a monolithic, difficult-to-maintain system into a modular, testable, and debuggable platform. The phased approach minimizes risk while delivering continuous value.

**Two-Phase Strategy**:
1. **Phase 0**: Establish critical foundations (rate limiting, errors, logging, config, testing)
2. **Phase 1**: Break down monolithic files into feature modules

---

## Key Principles

1. **Fix critical issues first** - Rate limiting, error handling, and logging prevent production incidents by safeguarding against excessive API calls, cascading failures, and service disruptions that could arise from new bugs introduced during refactoring.
2. **Configuration over code** - TOML configuration instead of hardcoded logic
3. **Test before refactoring** - Establish safety net before major changes
4. **Incremental changes** - Small, verifiable steps reduce risk by making changes easier to test, debug, and revert if issues arise. This approach enables continuous delivery, improves maintainability, and allows for adaptation based on new insights throughout the refactoring process.
5. **Preserve functionality** - All existing features continue working throughout
